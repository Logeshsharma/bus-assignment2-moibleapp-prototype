# Mix&Match - Speed Friending App for University Freshers

Mix&Match is a mobile app prototype designed to support freshers and international students in overcoming common social, cultural, and academic challenges when entering university. The app creates dynamic peer groups, encourages group-based activities, and connects users with mentors to improve social integration and overall well-being.
